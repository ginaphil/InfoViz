                Why do we need feminism across the world? Why do we need feminism in India? 
            </p>
            <p>
                The word feminism is controversial for multiple reasons but mostly misunderstanding. Feminism is grounded in the belief of equality of all, irrespective of gender identity. To understand feminism in today’s world, it is important to understand the opposition behind it. Many — both men and women — oppose feminism for several reasons, many of which are rooted in the fear of change. Some are unwilling to face the changes in tradition, culture, and power dynamics that are sure to follow an equality-based movement. Others are concerned about a supposed “feminist takeover”, through which women are planning to overthrow and dominate men. In reality, the goal of the movement is equality, which does not yet exist anywhere in today’s world, despite arguments otherwise.
